# ncappc

Installation

You need to have R installed. Download the latest version of R from www.r-project.org. Install ncappc in R from Github. Note that the command below installs the "master" (development) branch; if you want the release branch from Github add ref="release" to the install_github() call.
The install_github() approach requires that you build from source, i.e. make and compilers must be installed on your system -- see the R FAQ for your operating system; you may also need to install dependencies manually.

Follow the steps shown below.

install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("cacha0227/ncappc")

library(ncappc)
