<<concplot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=6, dpi=500>>=
for (i in 1:length(conc)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(grid.draw(conc[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5); grid.newpage()}
@

Concentration vs time profile for each individual stratified by dose or population group, if any, as obtained from the observed data. The left panels represent the raw data, while the right panels represent the semi-logarithmic form of the concentration data. Each of the thin lines represents individual data and the thicker brown line represents the smooth.

\subsubsection{Figure 2. [Population level] Histogram of the selected NCA metrics estimated from the observed data}

\paragraph{}
<<histobsplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=10, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(gridExtra))
for (i in 1:length(histobs)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(grid.draw(histobs[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5); grid.newpage()}
@

Histogram of four selected NCA metrics (AUClast, AUCINF\_obs, Cmax, Tmax) estimated from the observed data. The solid blue vertical and dotted lines represent the population mean and the "spread" of the data.The "spread" is either defined by the standard deviation or by the 95\% nonparametric prediction interval of the PK measures obtained from the study population.

\subsubsection{Figure 3. [Population level] Histogram of the simulated population means of the NCA metrics}

\paragraph{}
<<popplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(gridExtra))
for (i in 1:length(pop)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(grid.draw(pop[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5); grid.newpage()}
@

Histogram of the population mean of the PK measures obtained from the simulated data from the \Sexpr{round(nsim)} simulations. The red and blue solid vertical lines represent the population mean of the PK measure obtained from the observed data and the mean of the population means of the same PK measure obtained from the \Sexpr{round(nsim)} number of simulations, respectively. The blue dashed vertical lines represent the "spread" of the simulated distribution. The "spread" is defined as \Sexpr{print(sprtxt)}.

\subsubsection{Figure 4. [Individual level] Deviation of the simulated NCA metrics from the observed value}

\paragraph{}
<<devplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=
for (i in 1:length(dev)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(print(dev[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5)}
@

Deviation of the mean of the PK measures for each individual estimated from the simulated data obtained from \Sexpr{round(nsim)} simulations (meanSim) from the corresponding values estimated from the observed data (Obs). The deviation is scaled by the boundary of the "spread" of the simulated data (\Sexpr{print(sprtxt)}) proximal to the observed value (\textbf{Deviation = (Obs - meanSim)/ spread}). The negative value of the deviation signifies over-prediction of the corresponding PK measure, while a positive value of the deviation signifies under-prediction of the same.

\subsubsection{Figure 5. [Individual level] Distribution of the simulated NCA metrics for the outliers}

\paragraph{}
<<outlierplot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(gridExtra))
for (i in 1:length(outlier)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(grid.draw(outlier[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5); grid.newpage()}
@

Distribution of the PK measures obtained from the simulated data for the outlier individuals. The individuals are labelled as outliers because the absolute value of the scaled deviation for at least one of the PK measures used in diagnosis is larger than 1. The red and blue solid vertical lines represent the observed PK measure value and the mean of the simulated PK measure values for that individual, respectively. The dashed blue vertical lines represent the "spread" (\Sexpr{print(sprtxt)}) of the simulated distribution.

\paragraph{}
<<forestplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=

@

Forest plot of the NPDE type analysis displaying the mean and standard deviation of the NPDE vaues of the PK measures for different population groups. The red and green dots represent the mean and the standard deviation of the NPDE, respectively while the horizontal red and green lines represent the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals.

<<npdeplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=
for (i in 1:length(npde)){suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(print(npde[[i]]))); Sys.sleep(0.5)}
@

\subsubsection{Figure 7. [Individual level] NPDE values of the NCA metrics for each individual}
NPDE values of the PK measures for each individual within a given population group calculated from the corresponding observed and simulated values of the PK measures. The negative value of the NPDE signifies over-prediction of the corresponding PK measure, while a positive value of the NPDE signifies under-prediction of the same.

\paragraph{}
<<histnpdeplot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dpi=500>>=

@

\subsubsection{Figure 8. [Population level] Histogram of the NPDE values of the NCA metrics within a given population group}
Histogram of the NPDE values of the PK measures for all individuals within a given population group. The red solid vertical represents the mean of the ideal NPDE distribution, which is the theoretical normal distribution (mean=0, SD=1). The blue solid vertical lines represent the mean of the NPDE distribution for the corresponding population group. The dashed blue vertical lines represent the standard deviation of the distribution of the NPDE values within that population group.
